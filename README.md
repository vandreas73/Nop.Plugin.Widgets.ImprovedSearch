A search field is a useful feature of any website. If you have blog or other pages (topics) on your website, you might want to search in them. This widget shows the search results in blog posts and in topics (pages). Of course the default NopCommerce search works as well, after the default results (products) you will see the other results.

The extension searches the blogposts title, body, body overview and meta tags, similar to the topics. The extension's search will find only blogs and topics which exactly contains the searched expression, as it is in the NopCommerce search default algorithm. The minimal search character number is as it is set in Search.SearchTermMinimumLengthIsNCharacters.
